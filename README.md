# NMG Aerospace ITMaster App
![alt tag](http://www.nmgaerospace.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NMGAerospace_web-e1415574854644.png)

This is a database GUI that I designed and implemented during my internship at NMG AeroSpace.
I had to learn C# while coding this so please forgive bad practices.
The main idea is that I dynamically create buttons that link to database tables every time the App is loaded.
This allows for admins to add tables by just creating a new table in the database and you don't have to go in and change any code.
